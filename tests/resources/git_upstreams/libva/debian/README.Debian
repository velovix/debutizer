Package naming scheme for VAAPI drivers
---------------------------------------

The various VAAPI driver packages are named using a scheme based off of the
files that they install under /usr/lib/<triplet>/dri.

The *.so files from a driver package installed at /usr/lib/<triplet>/dri have
the name *_drv_video.so. The beginning part of those files are used for the
name of the driver package. For example, the i965-va-driver package contains
the *.so file whose name is "i965_drv_video.so".

Also, for drivers that provide more than one *.so file, the package are named
based off of one of the files, and they use a "Provides" package relationship
to provide virtual packages whose names are based off of the other *.so files.
This is the case with the vdpau-va-driver package.
